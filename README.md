### Description

Need those tricky split-rail voltages for your vintage electronics? The Adafruit TPS65131 Split Rail Boost Converter generates both positive and negative voltage rails from a single 3-5V input. This makes it great for mimicking or replacing a transformer-based power supply or something that needs negative bias. We kept the design compact, and it even has adjustable output pots, so you can tune the voltages from about +6~+15VDC and -6~15VDC. Perfect for use with audio or retro projects now that transformer supplies are hard to get, or if you want to have something that could run on battery or USB.

Features:

* The TPS65131 can generate positive and negative voltages simultaneously
* Adjustable voltage ranges: +6V to +15V and -6V to -15V, these are somewhat approximate because the trimmer pot can vary, you may find +/-0.5V variance on the bookend values
* Input voltage: 3 to 5.5V
* Output current: 150mA from each rail (assuming +12/-12V from 4.5V input). So not good for a motor, best for biasing or powering analog/digital electronics
* Compact breadboard-friendly design with mounting holes and two trimmer pots

We initially designed this to generate a -12V bias voltage on an Apple ][ disk drive, but you could definitely use it for synthesizers/modulars, TTL logic or op-amps that want a wide power supply, biasing LCDs or OLEDs, as well as other uncommon voltages. The trimmers let you tweak the outputs so you could get +6V and -12V or +12 and -8V.
